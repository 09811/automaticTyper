#Set up:
```pip install pynput```
Change your btime if needed
Change the text as described in the comment inside of the script

You can ajust the speed...

Nothing more to say.. It's a very small project maybe someone needs it...

In the example videos i used the script as it is. You dont need a sleep before debugging because it need some time


I use btime 0.8 because it looks like slightly sped up hand typing and it's not to boring
